# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview
This project classifies movies into genres based on attributes such as plot descriptions, cast, crew, and other metadata. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy of genre classification, especially for multi-genre movies.

## Dataset
We utilized the [dataset source, e.g., IMDb, TMDb] containing information on movies, including plot summaries, cast, crew, and release information.

## Objective
- To classify movies into one or multiple genres.
- To explore various machine learning and deep learning models and analyze their performance.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, text processing for plot summaries, etc.
2. **Model Training**: Training models like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and CNN/RNN for text classification.
3. **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics like F1-score, accuracy, and precision.

## Results
Detailed analysis and evaluation results of the models.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-genre-classification.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script: `jupyter notebook Movie_Genre_Classification.ipynb`
